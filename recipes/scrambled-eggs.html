      <h2>Description:</h2>
      <p>
        Scrambled eggs is a dish made from eggs stirred, whipped, or beaten
        together typically with salt, butter, oil, and sometimes other
        ingredients, and heated so that they form into curds.

      <h2>Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and
          a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob
          of butter and let it melt. Donâ€™t allow the butter to brown or it will
          discolour the eggs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20
          seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from
          the bottom of the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.</li>
        <li>
          Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places.
          Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.</li>
      </ol>
